# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is characterized by intermittent rendering failures, resulting in blank spaces or incorrect data being displayed during scrolling.  The bug is not consistently reproducible and presents significant challenges in debugging.

## Bug Description

When scrolling through a `FlatList` with a substantial number of items, the component sporadically fails to render some items, leaving gaps or showing outdated/incorrect data.  Standard optimization techniques such as `keyExtractor` and `removeClippedSubviews` have proven insufficient in resolving the problem.  The issue seems to be linked to memory management or race conditions within the `FlatList` implementation.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on a device or emulator.
4. Scroll through the list; observe the intermittent blank spaces or incorrect rendering.

## Potential Solutions

The provided solution explores a workaround involving using `SectionList` with smaller sections, potentially improving memory management and rendering performance. While this is not a definitive fix, it offers a more stable solution compared to relying solely on `FlatList` in this scenario. Additional investigation into native memory profiling might be necessary for a complete resolution.
